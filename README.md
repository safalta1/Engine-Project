## Background:
In order to make typing on a mobile device quick and easy, an autocomplete
feature is commonly implemented to try to guess what word a user wishes to type
before they are finished. Such a feature requires extensive use of search
algorithms. This project is a sophisticated implementation of an autocomplete engine designed to enhance typing efficiency on various platforms. By leveraging advanced data structures and algorithms, it provides fast and accurate word predictions based on user input.
